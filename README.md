# 🌐 alex-maundrell.dev — Portfolio Site (Version 1)

This repository contains the source code for **Version 1** of my personal portfolio website:  
👉 https://alex-maundrell.dev

This was the first complete version of my portfolio that I built and deployed. It represents an important stage in my development journey and reflects the skills and understanding I had at that time.

While I have since progressed significantly (see Version 2), this version marks the foundation of my structured, full-stack learning path.

## 🧠 About This Version

Version 1 was built to:

- Establish my online developer presence  
- Showcase my early projects  
- Practice real-world deployment  
- Build confidence working across front-end and server-side technologies  

It was my first full portfolio deployed to a live production environment.

This version demonstrates my early approach to:

- Layout and responsiveness  
- Component structure  
- Basic dynamic functionality  
- Organizing a real-world project for deployment

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Bootstrap  
- JavaScript  
- PHP  

This version combines static front-end structure with server-side functionality for forms and page handling.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Although I have moved on to Version 2, I committed Version 1 to GitHub to:

- Preserve the evolution of my development process  
- Document my growth over time  
- Maintain a record of my earlier implementation decisions  

Growth in development is measurable - and this repository captures an important milestone in that journey.
